# Fix Vercel Build Error - React.Children.only

## Problem
- Vercel build failing with "React.Children.only expected to receive a single React element child" error
- Error occurs during prerendering of `/community` page
- Root cause: Header component using deprecated `legacyBehavior` prop in Next.js Link components

## Tasks
- [x] Fix Header.tsx - Remove legacyBehavior and update to modern Next.js Link API
- [x] Test build locally to verify fix
- [x] Verify navigation styling and hover effects still work

## Status
- ✅ Fixed Header.tsx - Removed legacyBehavior prop and updated to modern Next.js Link API
- ✅ Build test passed - No more React.Children.only errors
- ✅ Navigation styling preserved (className and event handlers moved to Link component)
