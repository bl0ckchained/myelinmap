    { title: "Set Humble Goals", description: "Begin with achievable, narrow recovery goals (e.g., one day sober). Break larger goals into small, manageable action steps to build a sense of accomplishment and positive momentum." },
    { title: "Engage in Daily Reflection/Introspection", description: "Prioritize activities like meditating, taking walks, journaling, or writing daily gratitude lists. These practices focus thoughts, foster positive self-regard, process emotions, and help identify and replace negative self-talk." },
    { title: "Embrace Self-Care", description: "Prioritize physical health (healthy eating, regular exercise, adequate sleep) and mental well-being (engaging in enjoyable activities, relaxation). Self-care can include simple pleasures like sharing meals with friends or engaging in creative arts." },

  const essentialAdviceContent = [
    { title: "Seeking and Accepting Help", description: "Open and honest communication with loved ones is vital; individuals should not be afraid to ask for their support. It is important to understand that overcoming addiction often requires support and the development of new coping skills; expecting to change without help is often unrealistic. Furthermore, it is advisable to avoid approaches involving lectures, threats, or emotional appeals, as these can exacerbate feelings of shame and lead to isolation." },
    { title: "Developing a Personalized Recovery Plan", description: "Setting realistic, specific, and measurable goals is a cornerstone of recovery. This includes establishing a start date for abstinence or setting limits on substance use. Identifying personal reasons for wanting to change and outlining concrete steps to take are also crucial elements of this plan. Reflecting on what worked and what did not work in past attempts can provide valuable insights for future strategies." },
    { title: "Practicing Self-Care and Healthy Habits", description: "Prioritizing physical health is essential. This involves maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting processed and sugary foods and ensuring adequate hydration. Regular exercise, starting with low-intensity activities and setting realistic goals, is beneficial, with rest days incorporated for recovery. Sufficient sleep is also fundamental for both physical and mental well-being. Actively finding enjoyable activities, such as hobbies, sports, or volunteering, to replace addictive behaviors can create a fulfilling, substance-free life." },
    { title: "Managing Triggers and Cravings", description: "Identifying and actively avoiding triggersâ€”people, places, or situations that provoke substance useâ€”is a key strategy. Removing reminders of addiction from one's environment can also be highly effective. Keeping a detailed log of substance use patterns helps in identifying specific triggers. Learning and practicing various coping skills for cravings is paramount. Techniques include \"Urge Surfing,\" which involves mindfully observing the craving's sensations without acting on them. Mindfulness-based tools, such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, can also provide immediate relief. The SMART Recovery \"DENTS\" toolâ€”Deny or Delay, Escape, Neutralize, Tasks, Swapâ€”offers a structured approach to managing urges. \"Personify and Disarm\" encourages viewing urges as separate from oneself, making them more manageable. An \"Urge Log\" helps individuals identify when and why urges occur, allowing for pattern recognition and assessment of coping effectiveness." },
    { title: "Building a Strong Support System", description: "Leaning on close friends and family members provides invaluable support; relationship counseling may be beneficial if needed. Building a sober social network by connecting with new, supportive individuals is crucial. Regularly attending 12-step recovery support groups (AA, NA) or SMART Recovery meetings allows individuals to benefit from shared experiences and a sense of community." },
    { title: "Coping with Stress", description: "Developing healthy stress coping mechanisms is vital. This includes engaging in physical movement (e.g., brisk walks, yoga), practicing meditation, spending time in nature, or interacting with pets. Defining personal values and exploring new pursuits and passions can also help bring pleasure and meaning back into one's life." },
    { title: "Navigating Relapse", description: "It is important to understand that relapse can be a part of the recovery process, and it should not be a reason to abandon efforts. Continuously monitoring substance use and learning from any lapses is essential for long-term recovery." },
