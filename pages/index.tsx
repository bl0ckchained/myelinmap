              Welcome to <strong>Myelin Map</strong> &mdash; a tool for transformation
              built on the neuroscience of action and repetition. This isn&apos;t
              motivation. This is wiring.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            My name is Chad, and I created Myelin Map for anyone stuck in cycles they
            don&apos;t want to repeat. This platform was born from pain â€” and built with purpose.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            I spent nearly 20 years caught in addiction and survival mode. I read every book, tried
            every program, and failed more times than I can count. What changed everything for me
            was discovering <strong>myelin</strong> â€” the biological process that wires
            habits into your brain.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            Myelin is the insulation that wraps around your brainâ€™s neural circuits. The more
            you use a circuit â€” good or bad â€” the thicker the myelin becomes. That means the
            brain doesn&apos;t change because of motivation. It changes because of <em>repetition</em>.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
            Thatâ€™s what Myelin Map is: a visual habit-building platform that turns your daily
            actions into beautiful, brain-based progress. One rep at a time. One affirmation,
            breath, or pushup â€” whatever it is for you.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-emerald-300 font-semibold">
            This is a new kind of recovery. One that starts with love, and builds with action.
