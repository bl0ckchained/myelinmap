            üí¨ A Personal Message from the Founder
          </h1>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-200">
            Hi, I&apos;m Chad. This is my story &mdash; and what&apos;s worked for me. I want to start by saying this:{" "}
            <strong>Your story matters.</strong>
            What worked for me may not be the exact path for you, and I don&apos;t claim to have all the answers. I only know what pulled me
            out of the dark &mdash; and maybe, just maybe, it might spark something in you too.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-400">
            When I was very young, between the ages of 5 and 10, I experienced trauma no child should go through. My father married a woman who
            brought deep harm into our home. Me and one of my brothers were abused &mdash; emotionally, physically, and sexually. I have
            memories of standing naked in a basement corner all night while my dad was working midnight shifts. I don&apos;t know all the details
            &mdash; trauma has a way of blurring time &mdash; but the pain stayed, even when the memories didn&apos;t. I buried it. For 40 years.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-600">
            Fast-forward to 7th grade &mdash; I started acting out. I got in trouble constantly. I loved my dad, and I felt safe around him, but
            I never told him what was really going on inside me. I believed I was just a screw-up. That belief followed me into adulthood like a shadow.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-800">
            By my twenties, I had already racked up two DUI charges in a single week. I lost my license, fell into a deep depression, and dove
            headfirst into drugs. Heroin, morphine, cocaine &mdash; you name it. Addiction became my identity. I couldn&apos;t hold a job for more
            than a year or two. I was either back in jail, back on drugs, or stranded with no ride to work. I tried all the traditional recovery
            methods. Some helped, most didn&apos;t. I started to believe I was just... broken. A loser. That this was just <strong>who I was</strong>.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-bold text-emerald-400 italic text-center mt-8 animate-slide-up delay-1000">
            Then something unexpected happened.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-1200">
            At around 45 years old, I met a woman who told me about self-kindness and affirmations. I remember thinking, this can&apos;t be real.
            But something in me listened. I&apos;d tried everything else, and I had nothing left to lose. So I started small:
            <em className="block mt-2 italic text-gray-300">
              &ldquo;No, Chad &mdash; you&apos;re not a loser. You&apos;re not your past. You&nbsp;can&nbsp;do this. But you have to start.&rdquo;
            </em>
            And so I did. I quit drugs. I quit smoking. I enrolled in college. I confronted my past. I picked up books.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-1400">
            I read about trauma, the brain, healing, and hope. One book that changed everything was{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.google.com/search?q=what+happened+to+you+oprah"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 transition-colors duration-200"
            >
              &ldquo;What Happened to You?&rdquo;
            </a>{" "}
            by Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Bruce Perry. It taught me that the question isn&apos;t <em className="italic">‚ÄúWhat&apos;s wrong with me?‚Äù</em>{" "}
            but <em className="italic">‚ÄúWhat happened to me?‚Äù</em>
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-1600">
            I began to understand how trauma shaped my brain &mdash; and that healing was possible. It didn&apos;t matter that other people had
            &ldquo;worse&rdquo; trauma. What mattered was how my brain responded. I couldn&apos;t change what happened, but I{" "}
            <strong className="text-yellow-400">could</strong> change how I thought about it, how I treated myself, and what I did next.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-1800">
            Then I read{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+talent+code"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"

            >
              &ldquo;The Talent Code&rdquo;
            </a>
            , and my mind was blown again. It taught me that talent isn&apos;t born &mdash; it&apos;s <strong>built.</strong> Skill is built. Kindness
            is built. Recovery is built. Through repetition, our brain wires new pathways. These get wrapped in myelin, a substance that speeds up and
            strengthens signals in the brain. That means the more you repeat a thought or action &mdash; whether good or bad &mdash; the stronger it becomes.
          </p>

          <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-amber-400 italic text-center mt-8 animate-slide-up delay-2000">
            And here&apos;s the truth that changed everything for me:
            <br />
            You can rewire your mind. You can rebuild your life. One wrap at a time.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-2200">
            I&apos;m 49 now. I&apos;m clean. I&apos;m sober. I&apos;m proud. I&apos;ll graduate with my first degree in December 2025. And, fingers crossed,
            I&apos;ll finally have my license back too.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed animate-fade-in delay-2400">
            I still wake up and choose recovery every day. I practice self-love. I read, write affirmations, meditate, exercise, and keep learning.
            I&apos;m building this website to share the journey with you &mdash; not because I&apos;ve got it all figured out, but because I know what
