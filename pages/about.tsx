          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Myelin Map exists to help people reclaim their lives through consistent, meaningful
            practice. Rooted in the science of myelinationâ€”the biological process that wires habits
            into the brainâ€”our platform is a visual, interactive, and radically empowering system
            for personal transformation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            We believe that every action, thought, and habit you repeat is shaping who you&apos;re becomingâ€”and that change is
            possible for anyone, no matter their past.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            This isn&apos;t about perfection. It&apos;s about <strong>progress</strong>. You&apos;re not brokenâ€”you&apos;re mid-build. Let&apos;s grow forward.

            Myelin Nation is a community for doers, dreamers, rebuilders, and overcomers.
            We welcome anyone who&apos;s fighting to become their best selfâ€”whether you&apos;re escaping addiction,
            healing from trauma, or simply building better habits.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Our mission is to create a supportive, stigma-free space where daily reps lead to lifelong change.
            No shame. No judgment. Just growthâ€”one wrap at a time. Together, we celebrate every step, every stumble, every comeback.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            This is more than a movement. It&apos;s a <strong>rewiring revolution</strong>. Everyone&apos;s invited. Especially you.
