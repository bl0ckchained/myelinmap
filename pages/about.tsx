          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Myelin Map exists to help people reclaim their lives through
            consistent, meaningful practice. Rooted in the science of myelination â€” the biological process that wires habits
            into the brain â€” our platform is a visual, interactive, and radically empowering system
            for personal transformation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            We believe that every action, thought, and habit you repeat is shaping who you're becoming â€” and that change is possible for anyone, no matter their past.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            This isn't about perfection. It's about <strong>progress.</strong> You're not broken â€” you're mid-build. Let's grow forward.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Myelin Nation is a community for doers, dreamers, rebuilders, and overcomers.
            We welcome anyone who's fighting to become their best self â€” whether you're escaping addiction, healing from trauma, or simply building better habits.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Our mission is to create a supportive, stigma-free space where daily reps lead to lifelong change. No shame. No judgment. Just growth â€” one wrap at a time. Together, we celebrate every step, every stumble, every comeback.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            This is more than a movement. It's a <strong>rewiring revolution.</strong> Everyone's invited. Especially you.
