          <p>
            Myelin Map exists to help people reclaim their lives through consistent, meaningful
            practice. Rooted in the science of myelination — the biological process that wires habits
            into the brain — our platform is a visual, interactive, and radically empowering system
            for personal transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe growth shouldn’t be reserved for the privileged few. We believe that no
            matter your past, you can shape your future. And we’re building the greatest growth tool
            in the world to prove it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white">The Story Behind the Map</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Chad Adams Drummonds — I’m a father, husband, computer science student, and a
            man who’s been through hell and walked back with a mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            After losing my license in 2004, I spent nearly two decades in addiction. But since
            2019, I’ve been clean, climbing back step by step. I returned to school, dove into
            blockchain and neuroscience, and discovered something extraordinary: the brain can heal.
            It can change. It can <em>re-map</em> itself — with effort, time, and repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what Myelin Map is. A system I wished existed when I was lost. A way to see your
            effort. A visual trail of proof that yes — you are changing. And you are not alone.

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white">What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>
            While most self-help tools shout “just do it,” we ask: <em>how does the brain actually change?</em> Then we build from there.
