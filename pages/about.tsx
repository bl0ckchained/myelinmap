          <p>
            Myelin Map exists to help people reclaim their lives through consistent, meaningful
            practice. Rooted in the science of myelination &mdash; the biological process that wires habits
            into the brain &mdash; our platform is a visual, interactive, and radically empowering system
            for personal transformation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe growth shouldn&apos;t be reserved for the privileged few. We believe that no
            matter your past, you can shape your future. And we&apos;re building the greatest growth tool
            in the world to prove it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white">The Story Behind the Map</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Chad Adams Drummonds &mdash; I&apos;m a father, husband, computer science student, and a
            man who&apos;s been through hell and walked back with a mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            After losing my license in 2004, I spent nearly two decades in addiction. But since
            2019, I&apos;ve been clean, climbing back step by step. I returned to school, dove into
            blockchain and neuroscience, and discovered something extraordinary: the brain can heal.
            It can change. It can <em>re-map</em> itself &mdash; with effort, time, and repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s what Myelin Map is. A system I wished existed when I was lost. A way to see your
            effort. A visual trail of proof that yes &mdash; you are changing. And you are not alone.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white">What Makes Us Different</h2>
          <p>
            While most self-help tools shout &quot;just do it,&quot; we ask: <em>how does the brain actually change?</em> Then we build from there.
